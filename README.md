Butter Me Up, the killer Android app, now for iOS!

My good friend, Chris Hippenmeyer came up with the idea for the next killer app, Butter Me Up.
So far, it's been taking the world by storm with the [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattgmg.buttermeup) and
[Web App](http://butterup.me/).

Now... it's time to bring iOS into the 21st century.


#### Note

Butter Me Up is a super simple app, and was my first ever project on Android, from several years ago. 
This is my first experience ever with iOS, so I'm starting small :)
